Greece was first unified under Philip of Macedon in the fourth century BC. His son Alexander the Great rapidly conquered much of the ancient world, spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus River. Annexed by Rome in the second century BC, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The first century AD saw the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church, which shaped the modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox World. Falling under Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern nation state of Greece emerged in 1830 following the war of independence.

The President of the Republic formally appoints the Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet.\"},\n","  {'qas': [{'question': \"How many members are in Greece's parliament? \",\n","     'id': '57265504dd62a815002e81c2',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '300', 'answer_start': 38}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'How often are elections help for parliament?',\n","     'id': '57265504dd62a815002e81c3',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'every four years', 'answer_start': 198}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Parliamentary statutes are put into effect by who?

As member of the ESA, Greece participates in the agency's telecommunication and technology activities, and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Initiative.\"},\n","  {'qas': [{'question': 'What Greek scientist invented the Pap test?',\n","     'id': '57266556f1498d1400e8de3a',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Georgios Papanikolaou', 'answer_start': 68}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Who found the tomb of Philip II of Macedon?',\n","     'id': '57266556f1498d1400e8de3b',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Manolis Andronikos', 'answer_start': 230}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What Greek won the 2007 Turing award?',\n","     'id': '57266556f1498d1400e8de3c',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Joseph Sifakis', 'answer_start': 553}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What Greek won the 2002 Knuth prize?',\n","     'id': '57266556f1498d1400e8de3d',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Christos Papadimitriou', 'answer_start': 628}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What Greek won the 2005 Knuth prize?',\n","     'id': '57266556f1498d1400e8de3e',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Mihalis Yannakakis', 'answer_start': 689}],\n","     'is_impossible': False}],\n","   'context': 'Notable Greek scientists of modern times include Dimitrios Galanos, Georgios Papanikolaou (inventor of the Pap test), Nicholas Negroponte, Constantin Carath√©odory (known for the Carath√©odory theorems and Carath√©odory conjecture), Manolis Andronikos (discovered the tomb of Philip II of Macedon in Vergina), Michael Dertouzos, John Argyris, Panagiotis Kondylis, John Iliopoulos (2007 Dirac Prize for his contributions on the physics of the charm quark, a major contribution to the birth of the Standard Model, the modern theory of Elementary Particles), Joseph Sifakis (2007 Turing Award, the \"Nobel Prize\" of Computer Science), Christos Papadimitriou (2002 Knuth Prize, 2012 G√∂del Prize), Mihalis Yannakakis (2005 Knuth Prize), Dimitri Nanopoulos and Helene Ahrweiler.'},\n","  {'qas': [{'question': 'What is the religious minority in Greece?',\n","     'id': '57266792dd62a815002e83d0',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Muslim', 'answer_start': 34}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'The Muslim minority is mostly located in what city?',\n","     'id': '57266792dd62a815002e83d1',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Thrace', 'answer_start': 78}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Immigrants from Albania are usually what religion?',\n","     'id': '57266792dd62a815002e83d2',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Muslim', 'answer_start': 263}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Greek Muslims were in a population exchange with what country?',\n","     'id': '57266792dd62a815002e83d3',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Turkey', 'answer_start': 683}],\n","     'is_impossible': False}],\n","   'context': 'Estimates of the recognized Greek Muslim minority, which is mostly located in Thrace, range from 98,000 to 140,000, (about 1%) while the immigrant Muslim community numbers between 200,000 and 300,000.

In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (Greek Independence Day), Easter Monday, 15 August (Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin), and 25 December (Christmas). 1 May (Labour Day) and 28 October (Ohi Day) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.'},\n","  {'qas': [{'question': 'in 2012, what was the amount of the bailout?',\n","     'id': '5726909f5951b619008f76c3',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '$173 billion', 'answer_start': 117}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'How much debt to creditors was Greece suppose to reduce?',\n","     'id': '5726909f5951b619008f76c4',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '53%', 'answer_start': 280}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'In what year did Greece realize a budget surplus?',\n","     'id': '5726909f5951b619008f76c5',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '2013', 'answer_start': 512}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'How much did Greece make from a bond sale in 2014?',\n","     'id': '5726909f5951b619008f76c6',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '‚Ç¨3 billion', 'answer_start': 599}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'After how many years did it take for Greece to gain back growth in the economy?',\n","     'id': '5726909f5951b619008f76c7',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'six years', 'answer_start': 699}],\n","     'is_impossible': False}],\n","   'context': \"In 2011, it became apparent that the bail-out would be insufficient and a second bail-out amounting to ‚Ç¨130 billion ($173 billion) was agreed in 2012, subject to strict conditions, including financial reforms and further austerity measures.

By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander\\'s empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander.
